; Entered with a jump to f_escape when driver finds an escape, or
; to f_in_escape when the last string written to this device ended in the
; middle of an escape sequence.
;
; Exits by jumping to f_ANSI_exit when an escape sequence ends, or
; to f_not_ANSI when a bad escape sequence is found, or (after saving state)
; to f_loopdone when the write ends in the middle of an escape sequence.
;
; Parameters are stored as bytes in param_buffer.  If a parameter is
; omitted, it is stored as zero.  Each character in a keyboard reassignment
; command counts as one parameter.
;
; When a complete escape sequence has been parsed, the address of the
; ANSI routine to call is found in ansi_fn_table.
;
; Register usage during parsing:
;  DS:SI points to the incoming string.
;  CX holds the length remaining in the incoming string.
;  ES:DI points to the current location on the memory-mapped screen.
;  DX is number of characters remaining on the current screen line.
;  BX points to the current paramter byte being assembled from the incoming
;  string.  (Stored in cur_parm_ptr between device driver calls, if needed.)
;
; The registers are set as follows before calling the ANSI subroutine:
;  AX = max(1, value of first parameter)
;  CX = number of paramters
;  SI = offset of second parameter from CS
;  DS = CS
;  ES:DI points to the current location on the memory-mapped screen.
;  DX is number of characters remaining on the current screen line.
; The subroutine is free to trash AX, BX, CX, SI, and DS.
; It must preserve ES, and can alter DX and DI if it wants to move the
; cursor.
