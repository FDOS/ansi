----- UPDATE 2003: Complete freeware build chain for NANSI -----

You can build NANSI.SYS with the freeware version of Arrowsoft
Assembler (2.x, MASM compatible up to 286 code, max. 64k source
file size).

You can link NANSI.SYS with the freeware (if you sign up to the
Borland community, you can download old Turbo C and Turbo Pascal
and other compilers for free) Turbo C 2.x TLINK linker (you cannot
use the free VAL linker: allows no programs without stack segment).

There is an EXE2BIN tool that comes with FreeDOS. It is free open
source software, as all parts of FreeDOS.

If you have no MAKE tool, you can use the makefile.bat file
instead. MAKE (e.g. the one of Turbo C) is better, because it
only recompiles parts that have actually changed.
